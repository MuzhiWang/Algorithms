/*	Two dimensional array representation of an image can also be

 *	W represent row and H represent column size and each cell 
 *	represent pixel value of that image. You are also given a 
 *	threshold value X. For edge detection, you have to compute
 *	difference of a pixel value with each of its adjacent pixel
 *	and find maximum of all differences. And finally compare if
 *	that maximum difference greater than threshold X. If so, then
 *	that pixel is a edge pixel and have to display it.
